I am a passionate enthusiast of quantum computing hailing from Taiwan. My journey in the field of quantum computing began in high school, and I have consistently dedicated myself to learning and growth ever since. I have also achieved IBM certification, earning the title of Qiskit Advocate.

During my university years, I presented posters and research papers at both the Quantum Information Processing (QIP) and Quantum Computing Engineering (QCE) conferences. Over time, my passion for quantum computing has only grown stronger. I founded EntangleTech, a forward-looking quantum education platform, to share my knowledge and experiences.

Continuously striving to improve myself, I actively participate in quantum computing competitions and hackathons, achieving numerous accolades along the way. Currently, I serve as a research intern in the quantum centers of two universities, focusing on advanced research in quantum machine learning, quantum random walks, QAOA, and other quantum algorithms.
